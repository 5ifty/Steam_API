# Steam_API
A quick convinent handler to sort through the steamAPI


**How to use this**

Head over towards the Steam dev portal and apply for an API key 
[link](https://steamcommunity.com/dev)

Once you have recieved your key, either paste it into the index.py file and compile or when the console prompts you too, enter it.

If you're not using the .exe file provided then please feel free to look at the source code (index.py) and compile it yourself; all is open source to look at above.

Apart from that read the requirements.txt if you do intend on using the python file via your own CMD.


Thanks from 5ifty :)
