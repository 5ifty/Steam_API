# Steam_API
A quick convinent handler to sort through the steamAPI


**How to use this**

Step 1)
Head over towards the Steam dev portal and apply for an API key --> [link](https://steamcommunity.com/dev)

Step 2)
Once you have got your API Key either enter it into the command promt when asked too, or for later ease of access, enter it into the config.json* to stop you from having to keep enter it when using this. (**Make sure the config.json file and the SteamAPI.exe or the Index.py are in the same folder/directory**)

(*) Enter your API key into the empty quote marks

Step 3) 
Run the executable file/py file and enjoy

**Notes** 

If you're not using the .exe file provided then please feel free to look at the source code (index.py) and compile it yourself; all is open source to look at above.

Apart from that read the requirements.txt if you do intend on using the python file via your own CMD.


Make sure the SteamID you enter is the Steam64 ID(Hexidecimal ID) or this won't work - Find yours here [SteamID Finder](https://steamid.io/)
